## WordPress BASE ON "Skeleton"

* More easy to work on WP

## Assumptions

* `/content/` and `wp-config.php` add to gitignore after first deploy
* Custom content directory in `/content/` (cleaner, and also because it CAN'T be in `/wp/`)
* `wp-config.php` in the root (because it can't be in `/wp/`)

## Some guides

* Delete and add new database if any error occurs
* Wordpress version 4.6.1
* Ready to Start
